Blockchain technology is a peer-to-peer, immutable, and secure ledger system that has emerged as a possible solution to address the problems of centralized ballot and online voting systems, which are prone to risks regarding electoral integrity. This research evaluates the feasibility of blockchain-based voting technologies, analyzing their benefits and security assessments. Adopting a systematic mapping methodology, we extracted and analyzed relevant academic papers from multiple scientific databases that focus on blockchain frameworks applied to voting systems. Our evaluation is guided by three critical questions concerning the overall architecture, scalability, and security of blockchain-based voting systems. We aim to categorize and describe gaps and trends in existing literature, identifying areas that may require further research. Overall, the study identifies the benefits and limitations of blockchain voting technology from a robust democratic perspective.
